Coccyx.js
***
Coccyx.js is q tiny, simple and somewhat opinionated HTML5 and RequireJS/AMD compliant MVC library.

Tiny!
***
Coccyx.js is tiny!. How tiny, you ask? Well, the development version of Coccyx.js is currently 20kb and less than 600 lines of uncompressed, commented JavaScript and the production version is 6kb uglified and 2kb gzipped. And while it is expected to grow somewhat prior to its official release, the goal is to keep it tiny.

Full Featured!

Coccyx.js may be tiny in size but when it comes to features, it has everything you need to create fast mobile and desktop browser applications:Coccyx.js may be tiny in size but when it comes to features it has everything you need to create fast mobile and desktop browser applications:

+ HTML5 History Based Push And Pop State.
+ REST Based Routing Including Full Verb Support (get, post, put, delete).
+ Multiple Controllers.
+ Smart Models And Views.
+ PubSub.

Somewhat Opinionated!
***
+ It must be tiny without sacrificing features and usability.
+ It must be attractive for mobile development where fast load times are critical.
+ It must be runtime fast, where speed really counts.
+ It must be simple to understand and simple to code against.
+ It must embrace HTML5 and forgo support for older, non HTML5 compliant browsers because they must die.
+ It must be single developer as well as team focused.
+ It must support creating everything from small to huge, modularized browser applications.
+ It must be RequireJS/AMD compliant.
+ It must not be built using the pseudo-classical style.
+ It must allow developers to use plane old JavaScript objects.
+ It must target Ecmascript5 strict mode and must pass JSHint... except for the rare exception, emphasis on "rare"!

Still A Pre Release But Stable!
***
Though still a pre releasee, Coccyx.js is stable enough for you to begin using it now -- though not yet for production. So, if you are in the early stages of your development, by all means, feel free to begin using it now.

The absence of thorough documentation shouldn't prevent early adoption. If you are fluent in JavaScript then a quick study of the source code should suffice until the documentation page on this site is completed. Speaking of which, creating a kick-ass documentation page with meaningful examples as well will be the next highest priority.
